# Geuze

## Simple and fast website template with Netlify CMS and Eleventy

What if you could have the ***speed*** of a static website AND the ***flexibility*** of a content management system?

Well, you can have the cake and eat it! Or should we say have the bear and drink it...

## Getting started

### Deploy a Geuze site right now

It will only take a minute.

[![Deploy](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/Quinten/geuze&amp;stack=cms)

### Source code

You don't have to use Netlify, if you don't want to (although the contact form won't work properly). If you have your own server, you can fork this project [on github](https://github.com/Quinten/geuze).
